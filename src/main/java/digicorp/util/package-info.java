/**
 * Utility classes for the DigiCorp application.
 *
 * <p>This package contains helper components that provide common,
 * reusable functionality used across multiple layers of the system.
 * These utilities are designed to simplify repetitive tasks, reduce
 * boilerplate code, and centralize cross-cutting logic.</p>
 *
 * <p>Typical responsibilities of classes in this package include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>String manipulation and formatting helpers</li>
 *   <li>Date and time utilities</li>
 *   <li>Validation helpers</li>
 *   <li>General-purpose convenience methods that do not belong to
 *       any specific domain or service layer</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The utilities in this package are stateless and safe to use across
 * the entire application. They help maintain clean separation of
 * concerns by keeping non-business-specific logic isolated from
 * domain and REST components.</p>
